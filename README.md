# FriendFinder

This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

There are four pages the user can access.  The home page is the default page.  From there, the user can go to the survey page, the friend list API and the GitHub repo.

On the survey page, they are required to fill out all of the fields.  Once they click the submit button, a modal with their matched friend appears.  From there, they can either close the modal, or reset the page.
